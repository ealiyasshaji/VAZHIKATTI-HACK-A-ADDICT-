Vazhikatti will be a purpose-driven application designed to combat drug abuse and promote substance use prevention. It will address key challenges by enabling users to anonymously report drug usage and related activities, ensuring their safety while providing valuable information to law enforcement and policymakers for effective action.  

The app will foster recovery by connecting users with certified therapists and mentors who have successfully overcome addiction. This personalized support helps individuals navigate rehabilitation safely, with strict measures to prevent negative influences from peer interactions.  

By serving as a community hub, Vazhikatti will empower institutions and volunteers to host anti-drug events and programs, encouraging collective action and community engagement. Its unique behaviour monitoring system will identify and flag suspicious activities, allowing timely interventions to prevent relapses.  

Users will be able to share their recovery milestones and stories, creating a motivational ecosystem that inspires others on similar journeys. By integrating anonymity, professional support, and community involvement, Vazhikatti will provide a holistic solution to the challenges of drug abuse, empowering individuals and communities to build a drug-free future.
